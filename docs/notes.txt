I could be the event coordinator. I can organize with venues to secure availability. I can market. I already did some marketing last year with mailchimp and had a great reception to the idea. 
We can launch the webapp and gauge interest by having people sign up for events sort of like a pre-sale, at a reduced price. Then run with that program and iterate and improve. We would use it as beta testing. 
We can strengthen the idea through feedback. We can continue to iterate the app. 
We can explore different neighborhoods (zip code) and cities. 
We can run helper functions to group known zipcodes into neighborhoods. These neighborhoods would be identified manually. Along side the venue curation. 
We can recommend night caps (bars and other related venues) for the table of six to continue their night. 
We may not do the big social mixer every event night. 
The biggest thing is having the landing page and generating interest and data. How many users sign up, what dates do they prefer. Which cities are the most popular.
